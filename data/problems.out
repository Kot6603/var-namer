---
Calculate the area of a rectangle given its length and width.
--- WITHOUT CONTEXT
- The function name 'a' is non-descriptive; consider renaming it to something that reflects its purpose, such as 'calculate_area'.
- The parameter names 'b' and 'c' are vague; they should be more descriptive, e.g., 'length' and 'width'.

---
Calculate the area of a rectangle given its length and width.
--- WITHOUT CONTEXT
- The variable names 'length' and 'width' are clear and descriptive, effectively conveying their purpose.
- Consider renaming 'length_value' and 'width_value' to 'length' and 'width' to avoid redundancy, as their context is clear.
- The variable 'rectangle_area' is descriptive, but could be simplified to 'area' since it is already understood to represent the area of a rectangle from the context.
Suggested Improvements
    length_value -> length
    width_value -> width
    rectangle_area -> area
--- WITH CONTEXT
- The variable names 'length' and 'width' are clear and descriptive, making the code easily understandable.

---
Calculate the area of a rectangle given its length and width.
--- WITHOUT CONTEXT
- The variable names are generally descriptive, which aids in understanding the code.
- Consider shortening 'rectangle_length' and 'rectangle_width' to 'length' and 'width' since their scope is clear.

    calculated_area -> area
--- WITH CONTEXT
- The variable names are generally clear and descriptive.
- Consider simplifying 'rectangle_length' and 'rectangle_width' to 'length' and 'width' for better readability.
- 'calculated_area' is clear but could be shortened to 'area' since it is already within the context of rectangle calculations.

- Ensure consistency in naming conventions; using underscores consistently is good, but consider sticking to either singular or plural forms for similar variables.
Suggested Improvements
    cart_item_list -> cart_items

--- WITH CONTEXT
- The function name is clear and describes its purpose well.
- The parameter 'cart_item_list' effectively indicates a list of items in the cart.
- The variable 'total_cost' is appropriately named, as it accurately reflects the value contained.
- The variable 'cart_item' is clear but could be improved to specify that it represents a single item's data structure.

--- WITHOUT CONTEXT
- The variable name 'a' is not descriptive; consider renaming it to 'totalItems'.
- The variable name 'b' is unclear; a more descriptive name like 'pricePerItem' would enhance readability.
- The function parameters should be more descriptive to reflect their usage, e.g., 'computeTotalPrice(totalItems, pricePerItem)'.
- 'totalItems' is clear and descriptive but could be simplified to 'itemCount' for consistency with 'pricePerItem'.
- 'price' is overly generic; consider 'itemPrice' for better context.
- The variable 'result' could be renamed to 'totalPrice' to directly convey what it holds.
- Ensure consistency in naming conventions; stick to either camelCase or snake_case throughout.

- The variable 'items_count' is clear but could be improved for consistency. Consider using 'number_of_items' for uniformity in how you refer to the item count.
- The variable 'individual_price' is descriptive but doesn't match the naming style of the other variables. Consider renaming it to 'price_per_item' to maintain consistency.

--- WITH CONTEXT
- The variable name 'item_price' is clear and descriptive, effectively conveying its purpose.
- The variable name 'quantity' is also appropriate, but could be improved by specifying what is being quantified (e.g., 'item_quantity').
- The name 'subtotal' is clear; however, you might consider 'subtotal_price' for added clarity.
- The variable name 'tax_amount' is clear in its role, but consider 'tax_rate' if it implies a percentage instead of an amount.
- The variable name 'total_price' is clear and matches the expected outcome of the function, though consistency in naming could be improved.
- Consider using more context in variable names; for example, you might change 'total' in the main function to 'total_price' to match the previous naming convention.

--- WITH CONTEXT
- Consider renaming 'x' to 'numbers' for better clarity on what the parameter represents.
- The variable 'total_sum' is clear, but 'sum' is a built-in function name in Python; consider renaming it to 'even_sum' for uniqueness and clarity.
- While 'i' is acceptable in loops, consider using 'number' instead for improved readability and to convey its role in the context of the function.
- 'array' is a commonly used term, but 'number_list' would be more descriptive regarding its content and purpose.

Calculate the total price of items in a shopping cart.
--- WITHOUT CONTEXT
- The variable 'sum' is misleading as it shadows the built-in 'sum' function in Python. Consider using 'total_sum' or 'total' for clarity.
- The variable 'lst' is too ambiguous. A more descriptive name like 'prices_list' or 'price_array' would improve clarity about its contents.
