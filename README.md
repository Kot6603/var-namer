# VAR NAMER

This was a small project that was used for research purposes looking into variable name feedback using LLMs

`studentCodeGenerator.py` and `variableFeedbackGenerator.py` were used to generate synthetic student code and variable name feedback using LLMs respectively.

`feedbackCoding.py` is a program that made rating LLM responses more easier by displaying it's output into a better format.
